Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at 
the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to 
discover there was nothing to steal.

Ryokan returned and caught him. "You have come a long way to visit me," 
he told the prowler, "and you should not return empty-handed. Please take 
my clothes as a gift."

The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.
Ryoken sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow," he mused, 
"I wish I could have given him this beautiful moon."
